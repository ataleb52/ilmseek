						<h3>Travel</h3>
						<p>"Whoever treads upon a path of knowledge, Allah will guide him to a path of paradise" - Abu Dawud <br> Traveling for knowledge is something that Muslims have done since the beginning of Islam. Ilm Seek aims to have young Muslims travel to communities, events, and program outside of their hometowns to seek new knowledge, meet new people, and get exposed to new ideas. Traveling outside of their homes, will also give these Ilm Seekers the opportunity to acquire knowledge from means they might never have had access to. </p>

						<h3>Learn</h3>
						<p>During their travels, Ilm Seekers will gain knowledge mainly in the area of Islamic Studies. However that's not the only area we want them to focus on. They'll be interacting with people from different communities, attending events that were months or even years in planning, and get exposed to new ideas and things that they might have never though of. We want Ilm seeking to soak up every ounce of knowledge that they believe will help in further developing their community, whether it be something related to Islam or a new way of running things at their mosque.</p>

						<h3>Share</h3>
						<p>Upon returning from their travels, Ilm Seekers will have the opportunity to share what they have learned by performing two things.
							<ol>
								<li>Present and share their newfound knowledge to their community in an open forum and what their going to do to make a difference with that knowledge.</li>
								<li>Work on one community project. They'll be given the opportunity to put their creative thinking and entrepreneurial skills to the test with a self driven project that will focus on improving their community with their newfound knowledge. </li>

				<h2>What will you gain from being an Ilm Seeker?</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><p><span>Knowledge: </span>While the main focus of the program is currently on Islamic education, Ilm Seekers will be encouraged to seek out knowledge in other areas as well. This might include learning how other Muslim communities run their masjid, new ways of reaching out to people, or even just a new baklava recipe. We want you to come home thinking "my mind has been blown" because of all the awesomeness you’ve learned.</p></li>
					<li><p><span>Sisterhood/Brotherhood:</span> Ilm Seekers will travel in groups and be paired into teams. These teams will be required to work together, attending events, and presenting their knowledge together. Through the process of traveling and working together, Ilm Seekers will build a bond between one another that we envision becoming the future of what the Prophet Mohammad (pbuh) once called "Muakha", or brotherhood.</p></li>
					<li><p><span>Experience: </span>Not only will you get the chance to travel, attend events and meet new people. But you'll also gain experience working in a real world setting when you come home and start work on your project. You’ll have the chance to take an entrepreneurial mindset on your project and go wild with your ideas. Want to talk about a nice resume boost...how awesome will it be to tell a crowd listening to you speak that you started an awesome project in your hometown that became a national sensation?</p></li>
					<li class="no_marg"><p><span>The Opportunity To Make Things Happen:</span> The trips will be fun, you'll learn a lot, and make some good friends. But the best part is getting the opportunity to make a difference in your community. You'll have the opportunity to put together something that could easily change peoples lives. The project you'll work on when you come home isn't going to be another power point filled with boring bullet points. This isn't you're boring senior capstone class. We're looking for people that will come home from their travels ready to knock down walls, dream big, and make things happen.</p></li>
